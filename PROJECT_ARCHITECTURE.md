# Project Architecture: User Management UI

This document provides an overview of the architecture and relationships within the Angular project.

## 1. Project Structure

The project follows the standard Angular CLI structure:

```bash
user-mngt-ui/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── services/         # Application-wide services
│   │   ├── models/           # Data models and interfaces
│   │   ├── pages/            # Feature-specific pages
│   │   ├── shared/           # Shared modules, directives, and pipes
│   │   ├── app.module.ts     # Root module
│   │   ├── app.component.ts  # Root component
│   ├── assets/               # Static assets (images, styles, etc.)
│   ├── environments/         # Environment-specific configurations
│   ├── index.html            # Main HTML file
│   ├── main.ts               # Application entry point
│   ├── styles.css            # Global styles
├── angular.json              # Angular CLI configuration
├── package.json              # Project dependencies
```

## 2. Key Modules and Relationships

### a. **App Module (`app.module.ts`)**

- The root module that bootstraps the application.
- Declares and imports all components, modules, and services.

### b. **Components**

- Located in `src/app/components/`.
- Reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, forms, tables).
- Example: `UserCardComponent` for displaying user details.

### c. **Pages**

- Located in `src/app/pages/`.
- Feature-specific views (e.g., User List, User Details).
- Example: `UserListPage` for listing all users.

### d. **Services**

- Located in `src/app/services/`.
- Handle business logic and API communication.
- Example: `UserService` for managing user-related API calls.

### e. **Models**

- Located in `src/app/models/`.
- Define TypeScript interfaces and classes for data structures.
- Example: `User` interface for user data.

### f. **Shared**

- Located in `src/app/shared/`.
- Contains shared modules, directives, and pipes used across the application.
- Example: `SharedModule` for importing/exporting common Angular modules (e.g., `FormsModule`, `ReactiveFormsModule`).

## 3. Data Flow

1. **API Communication**: Services handle HTTP requests and responses.
2. **State Management**: Services share data between components using observables.
3. **Component Interaction**: Parent components pass data to child components via `@Input` and receive events via `@Output`.

## 4. Environment Configurations

- Located in `src/environments/`.
- Separate configurations for development (`environment.ts`) and production (`environment.prod.ts`).

## 5. Styling

- Global styles are defined in `src/styles.css`.
- Component-specific styles are scoped to their respective components.

This architecture ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability. For further details, refer to the Angular documentation.
